import pdb; pdb.set_trace();
*******************


todos:

move todos to trello

deal with orientation of phone

handle no response, ie a picture with no text

fix up the main() thing in helloworld, or make proper api anew

why is sometimes hitting twice?  is it just double-clid related, fixed with is_loading and/or spinner
or just shows exceptions twice?

have server function that basically wraps google vision API, so wants:
  - a list of features, and how many of each you want
  - the gs:// image_uri


have PICTURE_POST_URL be based on a variable that comes from the server, either indirectly via
dev_mode, or just have it be a part of the global state
