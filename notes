******** React native stuff

Haven't done android setup: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html

(vision)~/vision$ react-native init app
This will walk you through creating a new React Native project in /Users/dansilberman/vision/app
Installing react-native package from npm...
Setting up new React Native app in /Users/dansilberman/vision/app
To run your app on iOS:
   cd /Users/dansilberman/vision/app
   react-native run-ios
   - or -
   Open /Users/dansilberman/vision/app/ios/app.xcodeproj in Xcode
   Hit the Run button
To run your app on Android:
   Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
   cd /Users/dansilberman/vision/app
   react-native run-android

Image recommended sizes
FACE_DETECTION	1600 x 1200	Distance between eyes is most important
LANDMARK_DETECTION	640 x 480
LOGO_DETECTION	640 x 480
LABEL_DETECTION	640 x 480
TEXT_DETECTION	1024 x 768	OCR requires more resolution to detect characters
SAFE_SEARCH_DETECTION	640 x 480

In practice, a standard size of 640 x 480 pixels works well in most cases;
sizes larger than this may not gain much in accuracy, while greatly diminishing throughput.
When at all possible, pre-process your images to reduce their size to these minimum standards.

File Sizes
Image files sent to the Google Cloud Vision API should not exceed 4 MB.
Reducing your file size can significantly improve throughput; however, be careful not to reduce
image quality in the process. If you are batching images and sending them in one request,
also note that the Vision API imposes an 8 MB per request limit.

Usage limits
MB per image	4 MB
MB per request	8 MB
Requests per second	10
Requests per feature per day	700,000
Requests per feature per month	20,000,000
Images per second	8
Images per request	16
